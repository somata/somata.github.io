        h3 What is Somata?

        p Somata is a protocol and framework for building software on a network of connected microservices.

        p A Somata service exposes methods and events that can be called or subscribed to from anywhere else in the system.

        p This allows for distributed architectures to create pretty much anything &mdash; from a cluster of Node.js servers running pieces of an app backend to a network of home automation devices communicating across languages and platforms.

        h3 Why Somata?

        p Somata helps you build better, simpler software by
        ul
            li Following repeatable, modular architectural patterns
            li Interfacing simply with specialized parts of your system running on domain-specific languages
            li Developing asynchronously across a development team by enforcing separation of concerns
            li Exposing well-defined interfaces for simple test coverage and troubleshooting

        h3 How can I use it?

        p Somata has already been used for
        ul
            li <strong>Distributed API backends</strong> Decoupling the functionality of a web server into well-defined pieces, allowing you to build using repeatable patterns and change pieces of the code very flexibly
            li <strong>Home Automation</strong> Connecting Smarthings, Hue, and home built devices on a local mesh network

        p Somata has working implementations for Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, Java, and Scala. If you would like to contribute to Somata please visit the <a href='https://github.com/somata'>Github organization</a>.
