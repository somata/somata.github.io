        h2 What is Somata?

        p Somata is a protocol and framework for building software on a network of connected microservices.

        p A Somata service exposes methods and events that can be called or subscribed to from anywhere else in the system.

        p This allows for distributed architectures to create pretty much anything &mdash; from a cluster of Node.js servers running pieces of an app backend to a network of home automation devices communicating across languages and platforms.

        h2 Why Somata?

        p Somata helps you build better, simpler software by
        ul
            li Following repeatable, <a target='_newtab' href='http://microservices.io/patterns/microservices.html'>modular architectural patterns</a>
            li Enforcing separation of concerns, allowing asynchronous development across a team
            li Interfacing simply with specialized parts of your system running on domain-specific languages or hardware
            li Exposing well-defined interfaces for simple test coverage and troubleshooting
            li Enabling flexible, functionally-specific scaling strategies

        h2 How can I use it?

        p Somata has already been used for
        ul
            li <strong>Distributed API backends</strong> Decoupling the functionality of a web server into well-defined pieces, allowing you to build using repeatable patterns and change pieces of the code very flexibly
            li <strong>Home Automation</strong> Connecting Smarthings, Hue, and home built devices on a local mesh network

        p There are working implementations for Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, Java, and Scala. If you would like to contribute please visit the <a href='https://github.com/somata'>Github organization</a>.

        p To get started, <a href='/download'>install Somata</a> and <a href='/examples'>try an example</a>.
