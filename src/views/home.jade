        h3 What is Somata?

        p Somata is a protocol and framework for building software on a network of connected microservices.

        p A Somata service exposes methods and events that can be called or subscribed to from anywhere else in the system.

        p This allows for distributed architectures to create pretty much anything â€” from a cluster of Node.js servers running pieces of an app backend to a network of home automation devices communicating across languages and platforms.

        h3 Why Somata?

        p Somata helps you build better, simpler software by
        ul
            li 'Following repeatable patterns' (more specific way to say this?)
            li Interfacing simply with specialized parts of your system running on domain-specific languages
            li Subscribing to events anywhere in your system from anywhere else
            li Developing asynchronously across a development team by enforcing well-defined interfaces
            li Exposing well-defined interfaces for simple test coverage and troubleshooting

        h3 How can I use it?

        p Somata has already been used for
        ul
            li <strong>Flexible app backends</strong> Decoupling the functionality of a web server into well-defined pieces, allowing you to 'build using repeatable patterns and change pieces of our code very flexibly'
            li <strong>Occulus Vision</strong> Connecting a camera and gimbal on a raspberry pi to the streaming output from Occulus' gyros, for realistic turret-like vision
            li <strong>Home Automation</strong> Connecting Smarthings, Hue, and home built devices on a local mesh network
            li <strong>New Ideas</strong> Somata lets you code homogeneously across languages and platforms. This makes it ideal for distributed and embedded systems where flexibility is paramount.

        p Somata has working implementations for Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Scala. If you would like to contribute to Somata please visit the <a href='https://github.com/somata'>Github</a>. 'We would like to extend the protocol to as many languages as possible.'
